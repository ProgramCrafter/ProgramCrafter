[Manifold](https://manifold.markets/?r=QW5U) is a play-money prediction market platform where you can bet on anything. I also [bet there](https://manifold.markets/AnT?r=QW5U), and as of 2025-03-27 my calibration is such:

![Calibration graph with Brier score of 0.153](https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ProgramCrafter/blob/main/manifold-calibration.png?raw=true)

(I believe the numbers "market baseline" and "Brier score" can be subtracted to learn that I contribute 0.005 of something of information to the markets.)
