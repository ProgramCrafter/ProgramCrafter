I support Access Protocol Ï‰, also called 'last hope protocol'. In principle, that is.  
It is intended to provide access to maintenance-requiring services on my behalf if I'm unable to.

For Git repositories with suitable license, I suggest forking/pull-requesting instead - it is certainly faster!
