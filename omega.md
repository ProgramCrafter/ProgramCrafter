I support Protocol ω, also called 'last hope protocol'.  
That means, if I become unable to do something, anyone can acquire my authority to do that.

You can initiate Protocol ω by sending me an e-mail, containing text `protocol omega`.  
Then:
- either I'll respond you within 30 days, and nothing will happen,
- or you'll receive an identity certificate (issued by ROCYONERY AUTHORITY / PROGRAMCRAFTER AUTHORITY to PROGRAMCRAFTER/OMEGA IDENTITY) and
  access tokens to some services. These tokens will expire in 30 days.
