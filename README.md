### Who am I
You can name me ProgramCrafter, or CraftProger.

I am a middle developer; I know such programming languages as C++, Python, Lua, JavaScript...
As well, I had written some code in ActionScript and Rust.
I've seen Java and C# but didn't make any program with them.

I'm inactively (ðŸ˜‰) searching for some interesting tasks to work on. If you have one, feel free to contact me.

### Where it all started:
TL;DR: https://computercraft.ru/profile/23675-programcrafter/
- I registered on forum COMPUTERCRAFT.RU to participate in some special orders from admins.
- More specifically, it was https://computercraft.ru/topic/3292-printy-info-doska-i-pr/
- As well, I wanted to play Minecraft with OpenComputers on a server with friendly people.
- Minecraft server didn't open, so my works weren't seen "in life" ðŸ¤”

### What am I doing now
Playing Minecraft) (https://computercraft.ru/topic/5379-maynkraft-server-igraem-testiruem-dorabatyvaem/)

### My unfinished projects
- ***OpenComputers program for making computer-controllable factories with IC2 and AE2***
- OCTechnics - mod for doing the same but without need to move items between inventories
- ***Roctorio (there is a separate repository for it)***
- my own CMS in Python (what did I need it for?)
- auto-filling template of mod for Sid Meier's Civilization V
- neural network without ***numpy*** (if you know why my network does not train, please help me)
- tool for designing Kivy interfaces
- book about programming in Python, from zero level
  - really it's hard to do: what if someone doesn't even know what he needs?
- ***Mov processor architecture in several languages (currently making in Scala)***

### My finished projects
- chat reader for EPOS
- tool showing recent freelance orders from some sources (I didn't freelance yet, but I'm going to)
- small, almost non-interactive site for a company
- "anonimizing" bot in Telegram

### How to contact me *âœ‰*
