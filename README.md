### Who am I

I'm Ender "ProgramCrafter" Ting, of House Ting. A shorthand nickname I commonly use is "pcrafter".

I am a middle developer, and can work with either frontend or backend; I know such programming languages as Python, Lua, Rust, C++.
My experience includes development on TON Blockchain (and only it, so no EVM-compatibles!), which meant both designing contract architectures and writing code. I've largely moved to helping others to develop there, but my level in writing smart contracts in FunC matches senior dev.

It is possible you'll capture my interest by some task to work on! If you have one, feel free to contact me, whether by pinging on your project or opening an issue here. Though, taking on a full project is not very feasible because of studies (however, [ting-expense-a repo](https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ting-expense-a/) is really under scope of project practice in my uni). Please check out my repos for interests!

### Where it all started:
TL;DR: https://computercraft.ru/profile/23675-programcrafter/
- I registered on forum COMPUTERCRAFT.RU to complete some special orders from admins.
- More specifically, it was https://computercraft.ru/topic/3292-printy-info-doska-i-pr/
- Also, I wanted to play Minecraft with OpenComputers on a server with friendly people.
- Minecraft server hasn't ever opened, so my works hadn't been seen "in life" yet ðŸ¤”

### What am I doing now
Studying in National Research Nuclear University "Moscow Engineering & Physics Institute". A creativity outlet is writing and drawing, for private use.
